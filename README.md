# AccessibleMeme
Image-based memes are a fun, new mode of communicating jokes, political beliefs, etc. through social media. Unfortunately, the visually-impaired community is left out.  
Similar to programs that automatically generate alt-text on images, AccessibleMemes provides a text description of the meme image and the text overlayed on it.  
AccessibleMemes uses optical character recognition, structural similarity index, and a web scraper for KnowYourMeme.com for this purpose.
